# spanish-accents
Really simple AHK program to give you spanish accents similiar to the way you type them when you switch keyboards.  changes ' a in the  á , ' i into í and all these into í ó ú é ñ   and the / u  into ü   without the space obviously but I have to put that in or they will change. 

make sure you have accents2.exe as that is the release with the ¡ and ¿ by pressnig the windows key as you type ! and ?

Just double click the accents2.exe and it will run the autohotkey script in the background.

If you want it to alway run put it in your start up folder.  

Select the Start  button and scroll to find the app you want to run at startup.

Right-click the app, select More, and then select Open file location. This opens the location where the shortcut to the app is saved. If there isn't an option for Open file location, it means the app can't run at startup.

With the file location open, press the Windows logo key  + R, type shell:startup, then select OK. This opens the Startup folder.

Copy and paste the shortcut to the app from the file location to the Startup folder.
